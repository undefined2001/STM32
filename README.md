## About Registers of GPIO

A Microcontroller Have Many GPIO Pin and Few GPIO Ports. Basically GPIO Pin reffers to a single Pin on the other hand. A GPIO Port Reffers to a Group of Pin.
For Example:- 
GPIOB1, GPIOB2, GPIOB3 here 1, 2 and 3 are the pin number of different pin but GPIOB is the common port for all 3 pins. for a stm32 mcu there can ber several pin like that Ex, GPIOA, GPIOB, GPIOC .... GPIOH
